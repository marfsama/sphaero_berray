Applet version polish and error checking.

Should applet version allow cutter to be specified?

Why do all the pieces sometimes appear in the top left corner?

Why do keys sometimes not work in the applet?

JNLP version.

Better calculation of preferred size, keeping aspect ratio. Why not
just 1.25 in each direction?

Allow space in applet size for menubar and toolbar.

Application should accept a URL as the image location.

Cutters should handle not having a JProgressBar (need to check it's not
null).

Save and restore

Pause and resume (hide pieces while paused)

Should we replace pixelgrabber? BufferedImage will do subimage()
directly, which seems much cleaner.

Prompt window needs better spacing, and to follow the java look and
feel guidelines

Why do pieces occasionally become invisible?

Can we benefit from cacheing the images as we rotate them, so
subsequent rotations are free?

Should resize of large image be optional?
